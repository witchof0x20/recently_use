THIS HAS STOPPED WORKING FOR SOME REASON. DO NOT RECOMMEND USING

# Building
```sh
cargo build
```
or
```sh
nix build
```

# Running
```
cargo run -- /path/to/use/here
```
or
```
nix run /path/to/use/here
```

# Installing
This program is available as a Nix Flake (TODO: flake install instructions)

I don't usually do this, but you can probably
```sh
cargo install
```
